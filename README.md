# TIC_TAC_TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their symbol (usually "X" or "O"). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
